## Security

**Authentication:**
- All endpoints require Clerk authentication
- User must have a trainer profile
- "My Trainees" menu link only visible to users with trainer profiles

**Authorization:**
- Trainers can only access trainees they've trained (paid sessions)
- Trainers can only CRUD their own notes and media
- Enforced at API level with trainer ID checks
- UI conditionally renders trainer-specific features based on `/api/user/is-trainer` endpoint

**File Upload Security:**
- MIME type validation (server-side)
- File size limits enforced
- Private storage bucket (not publicly accessible)
- Filenames sanitized with UUID

**Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Enabled on TrainerNotes and TraineeMedia tables
- Policies allow trainers to access only their own data

## UI Flow

### 1. My Trainees List Page
**Route:** `/my-trainees`

Shows cards/table of all trainees:
- Trainee name and photo
- Session count
- Last session date
- Number of notes and media files
- Click to view detailed profile

### 2. Trainee Profile Page
**Route:** `/my-trainees/[traineeId]`

Tabs:
1. **Overview**: Basic info, goals, fitness level
2. **Sessions**: List of all past sessions
3. **Notes**: All notes for this trainee (add/edit/delete)
4. **Photos**: Photo gallery with upload

## Camera Capture Component

Uses browser MediaStream API:
```typescript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: { facingMode: 'environment' },
  audio: false
})
```

Features:
- Switch between front/back camera (mobile)
- Capture photo or record video
- Preview before saving
- Fallback to file upload if camera not available

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Video thumbnails (auto-generate from first frame)
- [ ] Video playback with controls
- [ ] Image editing (crop, rotate, filters)
- [ ] Bulk upload multiple files
- [ ] Share media with trainee (via email or in-app)
- [ ] Progress comparison (side-by-side photos)
- [ ] Video annotations (draw on video frames)
- [ ] Export trainee report (PDF with notes and photos)
- [ ] Media tags/categories (e.g., "before", "after", "technique")
- [ ] Search notes by keyword
- [ ] Video duration tracking and display

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can only see own trainees
- [ ] Can add/edit/delete notes
- [ ] File upload validates type and size
- [ ] Camera capture works on mobile
- [ ] Media deletes from both DB and storage
- [ ] Unauthorized users blocked
- [ ] Large file uploads show progress
- [ ] Error handling for storage failures
- [ ] Notes display with correct session info
- [ ] Media gallery loads quickly (pagination)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run SQL migration:**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase SQL Editor
   Run: docs/sql/add-trainer-trainee-notes.sql
   ```

2. **Set up Supabase Storage:**
   - Follow: `docs/setup/SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md`
   - Create `trainee-media` bucket
   - Configure storage policies
   - Set file size limits

3. **Environment variables:**
   Already configured in `.env.local`

4. **Test API endpoints:**
   - Get trainees list
   - Add test note
   - Upload test photo

## Cost Considerations

**Storage:**
- Free tier: 1 GB storage
- Estimated: 50 MB per trainee (100 trainees = 5 GB)
- Cost: ~$0.10/month per GB on paid tier

**Bandwidth:**
- Free tier: 2 GB/month
- Image views and video streams count toward bandwidth
- Cost: ~$0.09/GB on paid tier

**Optimization:**
- Use image transformations for thumbnails
- Lazy load gallery images
- Compress photos before upload (client-side)
- Limit video length (e.g., max 2 minutes)

**Ready to build the UI!** ðŸš€

This feature will significantly enhance the trainer-trainee relationship and provide valuable documentation for training progress.
