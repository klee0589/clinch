# üí≥ Stripe Payment Integration - Setup & Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

Your Clinch app now has a complete Stripe payment integration! Here's what's working:

### üéØ Payment Flow
1. **Trainee books a session** ‚Üí Session created in database (status: PENDING, payment: UNPAID)
2. **Automatic redirect to Stripe Checkout** ‚Üí Professional payment page hosted by Stripe
3. **Payment successful** ‚Üí Webhook updates session (status: CONFIRMED, payment: PAID)
4. **Redirect back to dashboard** ‚Üí Trainee sees confirmed, paid session

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

**New API Endpoints:**
- `/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts` - Creates Stripe checkout session
- `/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Handles payment confirmations from Stripe

**Database Migration:**
- `add-stripe-payment-fields.sql` - Adds payment tracking columns to Session table

**Updated Components:**
- `components/sessions/BookingForm.tsx` - Redirects to Stripe after booking
- `app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Shows payment status badges

**Environment Variables:**
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Added `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- Added `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (will be set after webhook creation)

---

## üöÄ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run the migration:

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zzxfdjoxddjmzhhytxzx/editor
2. Copy contents of `add-stripe-payment-fields.sql`
3. Paste and run in SQL Editor
4. You should see: "Stripe payment fields added successfully! ‚úÖ"

### Step 2: Start Your Dev Server

```bash
cd /Users/kangillee/Desktop/clinch
npm run dev:web
```

Your app will be running at http://localhost:3003

### Step 3: Set Up Stripe Webhook (Important!)

For payments to work properly, Stripe needs to notify your app when payments complete. We'll use Stripe CLI for local testing:

**Install Stripe CLI (Mac):**
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

**Login to Stripe:**
```bash
stripe login
```

**Forward webhooks to your local server:**
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3003/api/stripe/webhook
```

This command will output a webhook secret like `whsec_xxxxx`. Copy it!

**Update your .env.local:**
```bash
cd packages/web
nano .env.local
```

Update the line:
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # Paste your actual secret here
```

Save and restart your dev server.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook signature verification failed

**Solution:** Make sure:
1. Stripe CLI is running (`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3003/api/stripe/webhook`)
2. `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` matches the CLI output
3. You restarted the dev server after adding the webhook secret

### Issue: Payment succeeds but session not updated

**Solution:**
1. Check Stripe CLI terminal for webhook events
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `metadata.clinchSessionId` is being passed in checkout session
4. Check Supabase connection in webhook handler

### Issue: Redirected to Stripe but checkout page is blank

**Solution:**
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` starts with `pk_test_`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure price is a positive number (not $0.00)

### Issue: Can't find the session in dashboard after payment

**Solution:**
1. Refresh the dashboard page
2. Check the "Confirmed" filter tab
3. Verify you're logged in as the trainee who made the booking
