## üöÄ Let's Build This Thing

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
cd clinch
npm install  # Installs web, mobile, shared packages
```

‚òï Grab a coffee. This installs ~1500 packages (monorepo life).

### Step 2: Set Up Clerk (3 minutes)

**What it does:** Passwordless authentication for web + mobile. No passwords, no problems.

1. Hit up [dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up)
2. Create your free account (you'll love it)
3. Click "+ Create application"
4. Name it "Clinch" (or "Awesome Muay Thai App", your call)
5. Pick "Email" as your auth method
6. Fine-tune it:
   - Navigate to "User & Authentication" ‚Üí "Email, Phone, Username"
   - Toggle on "Email address"
   - Enable "Email verification code" (the magic passwordless bit)
7. Grab your keys from the dashboard

**Configure Web App:**
```bash
cd packages/web
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your Clerk keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding
```

**Configure Mobile App:**
```bash
cd packages/mobile
```

Edit `config.ts`:
```typescript
export const config = {
  clerk: {
    publishableKey: 'pk_test_...',  // Same as web
  },
  api: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3003/api',
  },
};
```

**Pro tip:** Mobile and web use the SAME Clerk keys. Copy once, use everywhere. üéØ

### Step 3: Set Up Supabase (5 minutes)

**What it does:** Your PostgreSQL database, hosted and ready. Stores users, trainers, sessions, all the good stuff.

#### Create the Project
1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Sign up (free tier is generous)
3. Click "+ New project"
4. Name: "clinch" (or whatever speaks to you)
5. Set a strong password and SAVE IT (you'll need this later)
6. Pick a region close to you (lower latency = happy users)
7. Wait ~2 minutes while Supabase spins up your database ‚òï

#### Get Your Keys
1. Open Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon) ‚Üí API tab
2. Copy your "Project URL"
3. Copy your "anon public" key

#### Configure the Web App
Add these to `packages/web/.env.local`:
```env
# Add to existing file
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

#### Create the Database Tables
1. In Supabase dashboard, open the **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Open `SQL scripts/supabase-schema.sql` from your project
3. Copy all the SQL
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Hit "Run" and watch the magic happen ‚ú®

This creates 8 tables: User, TrainerProfile, GymProfile, TraineeProfile, Session, Review, Message, TrainerGym.

#### Add Sample Data (Recommended)
1. Open `SQL scripts/supabase-seed.sql`
2. Copy, paste into SQL Editor, Run
3. You now have 3 sample trainers, 2 gyms, ready to explore

#### Verify It Worked
- Click "Table Editor" in Supabase sidebar
- You should see all 8 tables populated
- üéâ Database is live!

### Step 4: Launch! üöÄ

#### Start the Web App
```bash
npm run dev:web
```

üí• Opens at `http://localhost:3003`

You should see the Clinch homepage. Click around, browse trainers, check out the UI.

#### Start Mobile (Optional)
Open a NEW terminal:
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

This fires up the Expo Metro bundler and shows you a QR code.

#### Connect Your Phone
1. Install "Expo Go" from App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android)
2. **iOS users**: Open your Camera app, point at the QR code
3. **Android users**: Open Expo Go, tap "Scan QR code"
4. Watch your app load on your phone üì±

**Note**: Phone and computer must be on the same WiFi network.

#### 2. Explore the Marketplace

#### 3. Book a Session

### Mobile App Experience

Try the same flows on your phone:
1. Open the app via Expo Go
2. Sign in with the SAME account you just created on web
3. Browse trainers (pull down to refresh - feels native!)
4. Book a session
5. Check your dashboard
6. Notice how data syncs instantly between web and mobile

**The sync is real:** Book on web, see it on mobile. Accept a booking on mobile, see it update on web. Same database, same auth, different devices.

## Troubleshooting

### Web App Issues

**"Publishable key not valid" error:**
- Check that you copied the FULL key from Clerk
- Make sure no extra spaces in `.env.local`
- Restart the dev server

**Database/API errors:**
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
- Check that Supabase project is running (green status in dashboard)
- Make sure you ran the schema SQL script

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill process on port 3003
lsof -ti:3003 | xargs kill -9
# Then restart
npm run dev:web
```

### Mobile App Issues

**Metro bundler won't start:**
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
cd packages/mobile
npx expo start -c
```

**Can't connect to API:**
- Make sure web server is running first (`npm run dev:web`)
- Check that `config.ts` has correct API URL
- If using physical device, ensure phone and computer are on same WiFi network
- For physical devices, update `baseUrl` to your computer's local IP:
  ```typescript
  baseUrl: 'http://192.168.1.X:3003/api'  // Replace X with your IP
  ```

**"Unable to resolve module" errors:**
```bash
cd packages/mobile
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo start -c
```

**Watchman errors (Mac):**
```bash
watchman shutdown-server
watchman watch-del-all
```
