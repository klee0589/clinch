# 🚀 Release Notes - Clinch v0.6.0

## 💳 Stripe Payment Integration (Major Feature)

We've integrated full Stripe payment processing into Clinch! Trainees can now book and pay for sessions seamlessly.

### What's New

#### 🎯 Core Payment Features
- **Stripe Checkout Integration**: Secure payment processing via Stripe Checkout
- **Real-time Payment Status**: Sessions automatically update when payments complete
- **Webhook Support**: Automated payment confirmation via Stripe webhooks
- **Payment Status Badges**: Visual indicators for payment states (Unpaid, Pending, Paid, Refunded)
- **Session Auto-confirmation**: Sessions automatically confirmed upon successful payment

#### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- Stripe Checkout API integration
- Webhook endpoint for payment events (`/api/stripe/webhook`)
- Checkout session creation (`/api/stripe/create-checkout-session`)
- Database schema updates for payment tracking
- Payment status management in session workflow

#### 📊 Database Updates
New columns added to `Session` table:
- `stripePaymentIntentId`: Stripe payment intent ID
- `stripeCheckoutSessionId`: Stripe checkout session ID
- `paymentStatus`: Payment status (UNPAID, PENDING, PAID, REFUNDED)

#### 🎨 UI Updates
- Payment status badges on dashboard
- Seamless redirect flow after payment
- Clear payment processing indicators
- Success/cancel URL handling

### Payment Flow

1. **Trainee books session** → Creates session in database with PENDING status
2. **Redirects to Stripe Checkout** → Secure payment page
3. **Payment completed** → Webhook updates session to PAID and CONFIRMED
4. **Returns to dashboard** → Session shows as confirmed and paid
