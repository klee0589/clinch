# 🎉 What's New in Clinch v0.6 - Payment Integration

## 💳 Major Feature: Stripe Payment Processing

Your Clinch marketplace now processes real payments! Trainees can pay for sessions securely with any credit or debit card.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 🔐 Secure Payment Flow
1. **Book a session** → Session created in database
2. **Automatic redirect** → Stripe hosted checkout page
3. **Pay securely** → All major cards supported
4. **Auto-confirmation** → Session confirmed when payment succeeds
5. **Dashboard update** → See your confirmed, paid session

### 💰 Payment Status Tracking
Sessions now show real-time payment status:
- **Unpaid** (Gray) - Session created, payment not started
- **Pending** (Yellow) - At Stripe checkout, payment processing
- **Paid** (Green) - Payment successful, session confirmed
- **Refunded** (Blue) - Payment refunded (future feature)

### 🛡️ Security & Compliance
- **PCI Compliant** - Stripe handles all sensitive card data
- **Webhook Verification** - Cryptographic signature checking
- **Environment Protection** - API keys never exposed to frontend
- **Secure Database** - Payment IDs stored, never card details

### 🧪 Developer-Friendly Testing
- **Test Mode** - Full Stripe test environment
- **Test Cards** - Various scenarios (success, decline, 3D Secure)
- **Stripe CLI** - Local webhook forwarding for development
- **No Real Money** - Safe testing without actual charges

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session` - Initiates payment
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` - Handles payment events from Stripe

### Database Changes
New columns added to `Session` table:
```sql
stripePaymentIntentId    TEXT    -- Stripe payment identifier
stripeCheckoutSessionId  TEXT    -- Stripe checkout session ID
paymentStatus           TEXT    -- UNPAID, PENDING, PAID, REFUNDED
```

### Updated Components
- **BookingForm** - Redirects to Stripe after creating session
- **Dashboard** - Shows payment status badges
- **Session API** - Tracks payment intent IDs

### Dependencies Added
- `stripe` (v17+) - Server-side Stripe SDK
- `@stripe/stripe-js` (v5+) - Client-side Stripe utilities

## 🎯 What Changed

### User Experience
**Before v0.6:**
- Book session → Status: PENDING
- Trainer manually accepts/declines
- Payment mentioned but not processed
- No actual money changes hands

**After v0.6:**
- Book session → Redirect to Stripe Checkout
- Pay with card → Session auto-confirmed
- Trainer sees confirmed, paid bookings
- Real payments processed securely

### Booking Flow
```
OLD: Book → PENDING → Trainer Accept → CONFIRMED
NEW: Book → Pay → CONFIRMED (automatic)
```

Trainers can still decline paid sessions, but refunds are not yet automated (future feature).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Run Database Migration
Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```bash
cat add-stripe-payment-fields.sql
```

### 2. Your Stripe Keys Are Already Set!
Already configured in `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_***
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_***
```

### 3. Setup Webhook (Required!)
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to localhost
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# Copy the webhook secret (whsec_xxx) to .env.local
```

### 4. Test Your First Payment
1. Go to http://localhost:3000 (server is running!)
2. Sign in and book a session
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. See your confirmed, paid session in dashboard
