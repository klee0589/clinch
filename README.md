- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with direct REST API client
- **Validation**: Zod

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase)
- Clerk account for authentication

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
cd clinch
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Run the SQL scripts in Supabase SQL Editor:
   - `supabase-schema.sql` - Creates all tables, enums, and indexes
   - `supabase-seed.sql` - Seeds sample data (3 trainers, 2 gyms, etc.)
3. Get your project URL and anon key from Project Settings â†’ API

### 3. Set Up Clerk

1. Create an account at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Get your publishable and secret keys from the API Keys section
4. In Clerk Dashboard:
   - Go to User & Authentication â†’ Email, Phone, Username â†’ Enable email
   - Configure OAuth providers (Google, etc.) if desired

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

#### Web Package
```bash
cd packages/web
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add:
```env
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/onboarding

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 5. Set Up Database

**Note**: We use Supabase REST API directly instead of Prisma due to connection issues.

```bash
# Run schema setup in Supabase SQL Editor
# 1. Copy contents of supabase-schema.sql
# 2. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
# 3. Execute

# Run seed data
# 1. Copy contents of supabase-seed.sql
# 2. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
# 3. Execute

# To add a trainee profile for testing bookings:
# 1. Copy contents of add-trainee-profile.sql
# 2. Update the user ID to match your account
# 3. Execute in SQL Editor
```

### 6. Run Development Server

```bash
# Web app (runs on http://localhost:3001)
npm run dev:web
```

### 7. Create Test Account

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Get Started" to sign up
3. Complete onboarding and select your role:
   - **Trainee**: To book sessions with trainers
   - **Trainer**: To receive and manage booking requests
   - **Gym Owner**: To manage gym profile (future feature)

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Make your code changes
2. Test locally with `npm run dev:web`
3. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Your message"`
4. Pre-commit hook automatically:
   - Runs all 38 validation tests
   - Formats code with Prettier
   - Blocks commit if tests fail
5. Push to GitHub: `git push`

### Adding New Features

1. Update database schema in `supabase-schema.sql` if needed
2. Add/update API endpoints in `packages/web/app/api/`
3. Create/update UI components in `packages/web/components/`
4. Add validation schemas in `packages/shared/src/validations/`
5. Write tests for new validations
6. Update this README with new features

### Testing Different User Roles

1. **As Trainee**:
   - Sign up â†’ Select "I'm looking for training"
   - Browse trainers â†’ Book session
   - View bookings in Dashboard â†’ "My Bookings" tab

2. **As Trainer**:
   - Sign up with different email
   - Select "I'm a Trainer"
   - Have someone book you (or use another account)
   - View Dashboard â†’ "Booking Requests" tab
   - Accept/Decline bookings

3. **Sign Out**: Click "Sign Out" button in dashboard header

## Project Conventions

### User Roles
- `TRAINEE`: Looking for training
- `TRAINER`: Offering training services
- `GYM_OWNER`: Gym facility owner
- `ADMIN`: Platform administrator

### Muay Thai Styles
- Traditional
- Dutch Style
- Golden Age
- Modern
- Fitness/Cardio

### Session Status Flow
```
PENDING â†’ (Trainer accepts) â†’ CONFIRMED â†’ COMPLETED
       â†“ (Trainer declines)
     CANCELLED
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

If you see Prisma connection errors, the app uses Supabase REST API as a workaround:
- All endpoints use `/api/*-supabase` routes
- Direct Supabase client instead of Prisma
- Same functionality, different implementation

### Can't Book Sessions

Make sure you have a trainee profile:
1. Run `add-trainee-profile.sql` with your user ID
2. Or create a new account and select "Trainee" role

### Pre-commit Hook Fails

If tests fail on commit:
```bash
# Run tests manually to see errors
npm test

# Fix issues, then commit again
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```
